# By Univeristy of Colorado Boulder Space Environment Data Analysis Group (CU SEDA)
# Glossary:
# EQ1: First equator-side auroral boundary encountered by spacecraft
# PO1: First pole-side auroral boundary encountered by spacecraft
# PO2: Second equator-side auroral boundary encountered by spacecraft
# EQ2: Second equatorward auroral boundary encountered by spacecraft
# FOM: Unitless figure of merit for boundary identification, smaller is worse, Rule of Thumb: < 1.8 is questionable
# ind: record number (row) of DMSP SSJ CDF file corresponding to boundary
# hemisphere : -1 for southern hemisphere +1 for northern
